All of this code is written from scratch by 
Greg Naughton.  This is why some of it still 
sucks and also why some of it is awesome.  
It is a work in progress.

Features (or lack of) so far:
- 100% native windows/opengl backend
- there is no sound yet
- supports fullscreen and windowed mode
- 3 maps
- Poor Collision Detection
- Stupid Ghost Behavior
- No Menus of any kind

Enjoy.  Send comments/suggestions/bugs to

* Use the arrow keys to move.

special keys:
- try the 'r' key for an extra challenge (press 'r' again to stop)
- the 'f' key cycles through a few different fonts I was trying out.
- 'p' will pause & unpause the game

More keys:
'z', 'i', 'b', 'h', 't'  - these will alter various refresh/update 
characteristics.  The gameplay will be effected.
's' - toggles showfps

'c' - is a cheat that gives free guys, but only so many ...
'l' - fast forwards through the map-levels

Fullscreen:
for fullscreen mode, execute the fullscreen.bat file
